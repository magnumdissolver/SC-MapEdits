# SC-MapEdits

Map edits for the game `Sven Co-op` made with `ripent`, mainly focused for guiding players into the right direction in public servers, since most of them aren't comunicating with each other, so it's common to see them wandering around not knowing what to do and where to go.

These edits helps by adding visual indicators of what to collect to proceed, and when something deserves more attention of everyone a cutscene is used to indicate the next route that should be taken.

This usually happens for maps that have certain traits like item hunting and backtracking, and are specially necessary when the map in question have bad level desing. which is a common thing.
