# SC-MapEdits

Map edits for the game `Sven Co-op` made with `ripent` mainly focused for guiding players into the right direction in public servers since most of the they aren't comunicating with each other so it's common to see them wandering around not knowing what to do and where to go.
This usually happens for maps that have very certains traits like item hunting and backtracking with these edits it helps by adding visual indicators of what to collect to proceed and when something that deserves more attention of everyone a cutscene is used to indicate the next route that should be taken.
